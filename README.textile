h1. Kitabu

Forked from "fnando/kitabu":https://github.com/fnando/kitabu.

This fork of kitabu is used to generate the tutorials for the RailsApps project.

The HTML output is designed for the stylesheets used by the "Twitter Bootstrap documentation":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html, specifically the "scrollspy" feature.

Changes:

* Add .rvmrc file
* Change output of the TOC for HTML version
* Only include h2 headings in the TOC
* Wrap @<h2>@ tags in section tags

Structure:

* One chapter per file in the text folder
* Use only one @<h2>@ tag per chapter
